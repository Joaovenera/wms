# Operation Types Implementation Test Plan

## Summary of Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
- Added `type` field to transfer_requests table (VARCHAR, NOT NULL)
- Added operation-specific fields:
  - `supplier_name` - For arrival plans (container, truck, delivery)  
  - `transporter_name` - For delivery arrivals
  - `estimated_arrival` - For arrival plans (TIMESTAMP)
  - `client_info` - For withdrawal plans (JSONB)
- Created migration script at `/backend/src/db/migrations/add-operation-types.sql`

### 2. Backend Controller Updates ✅ 
- Updated createTransferRequest to accept new fields:
  - `type` (required, validated against allowed types)
  - `supplierName`, `transporterName`, `estimatedArrival`, `clientInfo`
- Added validation for operation types:
  - container-arrival-plan
  - truck-arrival-plan
  - delivery-arrival-plan
  - transfer-plan
  - withdrawal-plan

### 3. Frontend Interface Updates ✅
- TransferRequest interface already had the required fields
- Enhanced `getOperationInfo` function with:
  - Better descriptions for each operation type
  - More detailed information display
  - Improved error handling for unknown types
  - Better visual indicators

### 4. Operation Type Display Improvements ✅
- **Container Arrivals**: Ship icon, blue theme, supplier info
- **Truck Arrivals**: Truck icon, green theme, supplier info  
- **Delivery Arrivals**: Package icon, purple theme, transporter + supplier info
- **Transfer Plans**: Truck icon, blue theme, origin → destination
- **Withdrawal Plans**: UserCheck icon, orange theme, client info + document
- **Unknown Types**: AlertTriangle icon, red theme, helpful error message

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Database Migration
- [ ] Run migration to add columns to existing database
- [ ] Verify all existing transfer_requests get default 'transfer-plan' type
- [ ] Test constraint validation for operation types

### 2. API Testing
- [ ] Test creating each operation type via API
- [ ] Verify operation-specific fields are stored correctly
- [ ] Test validation of invalid operation types

### 3. UI Testing  
- [ ] Create plans using each wizard type
- [ ] Verify operations display with correct icons/colors
- [ ] Test loading-execution page shows proper operation info
- [ ] Verify unknown/missing types show helpful error message

### 4. End-to-End Workflow
- [ ] Container Arrival: Create plan → Approve → Execute  
- [ ] Truck Arrival: Create plan → Approve → Execute
- [ ] Delivery Arrival: Create plan → Approve → Execute
- [ ] Transfer Plan: Create plan → Approve → Execute
- [ ] Withdrawal Plan: Create plan → Approve → Execute

## Current Status
- ✅ Code changes implemented
- ⚠️ Database migration needs to be applied
- ⚠️ Backend restart needed to load new schema
- ⚠️ Testing needed to verify functionality

## Next Steps
1. Apply database migration
2. Test creating new plans of each type
3. Verify operation display in loading-execution page
4. Fix any issues discovered during testing
