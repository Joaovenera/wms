# Bundle Optimization Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive bundle optimization strategy implemented for the WMS Frontend application. The strategy focuses on achieving optimal performance through intelligent chunking, tree-shaking, compression, and caching strategies.

## Performance Targets

### Bundle Size Budgets
- **Total JavaScript**: 800KB (uncompressed)
- **Total CSS**: 100KB (uncompressed)
- **Main Chunk**: 250KB maximum
- **Vendor Chunks**: 300KB maximum per chunk
- **Async Chunks**: 200KB maximum per chunk

### Performance Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.8s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1

## Bundle Splitting Strategy

### 1. Vendor Chunk Optimization

**React Core** (`react-core`)
- `react` and `react-dom` - Critical for application bootstrap
- Size target: ~100KB
- Caching: High (rarely changes)

**Radix UI Components** (Split by usage patterns)
- `radix-core`: Dialog, Button, Input, Toast, Card, Tabs (~80KB)
- `radix-menu`: Navigation, Dropdown, Context menus (~60KB)
- `radix-forms`: Select, Checkbox, Radio, Slider, Switch (~70KB)
- `radix-layout`: Accordion, Collapsible, Separator (~50KB)

**Heavy Libraries**
- `animations`: Framer Motion (~150KB)
- `charts`: Recharts and chart utilities (~200KB)
- `icons`: Lucide React with tree-shaking (~50KB optimized)

**Utilities**
- `utilities`: Date-fns, Zod, Clsx, Tailwind utilities (~80KB)
- `state-routing`: React Query, Wouter (~100KB)

### 2. Application Code Splitting

**Core Application** (`app-main`)
- Main App component and core routing
- Size target: ~100KB

**UI Components**
- `ui-core`: Button, Input, Card, Dialog, Toast, Form (~80KB)
- `ui-extended`: Advanced UI components (~120KB)

**Feature-Based Chunks**
- `features-warehouse`: Warehouse map and tracking (~150KB)
- `features-transfer`: Transfer planning and reports (~120KB)
- `features-scanner`: QR scanner and camera features (~100KB)
- `features-management`: Product and packaging management (~130KB)

**Page-Based Chunks**
- `pages-core`: Dashboard, Auth, Landing (~100KB)
- `pages-inventory`: Products, Pallets, Stock management (~140KB)
- `pages-logistics`: Transfer, Vehicles, Tracking (~130KB)
- `pages-mobile`: Mobile-specific pages (~80KB)
- `pages-admin`: Administrative features (~90KB)

## Tree-Shaking Optimization

### 1. Import Strategy Optimization

**Named Imports (Preferred)**
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Tree-shakable
import { Button, Input } from '@/components/ui'
import { debounce } from 'lodash-es'
import { Calendar, User } from 'lucide-react'

// ❌ Avoid - Not tree-shakable
import * as UI from '@/components/ui'
import _ from 'lodash'
import * as Icons from 'lucide-react'
```

**Library-Specific Optimizations**
- **Radix UI**: Use individual component imports
- **Lucide React**: Named imports reduce bundle by 80%
- **Date-fns**: Use ESM version with named imports
- **Lodash**: Use `lodash-es` with named imports

### 2. Side Effect Management

**Marked as Side-Effect Free**
- All utility functions
- Pure UI components
- Type definitions
- Configuration files

**Known Side Effects**
- CSS imports
- React DOM initialization
- Service worker registration
- Global style injections

## Compression Strategy

### 1. Multiple Compression Formats

**Gzip Compression**
- Target ratio: 70% (0.3 compression ratio)
- Threshold: 1KB minimum file size
- Generated for all assets

**Brotli Compression**
- Target ratio: 75% (0.25 compression ratio)
- Better compression than gzip
- Modern browser support

### 2. Asset Optimization

**JavaScript Minification**
- Terser with advanced optimizations
- Dead code elimination
- Console statement removal
- Property mangling for private properties

**CSS Optimization**
- PurgeCSS for unused styles
- Critical CSS extraction
- Automatic vendor prefixing

## Caching Strategy

### 1. Cache Groups by Mutability

**High Cacheability** (Long-term caching)
- Vendor chunks (React, Radix UI, etc.)
- Utility libraries
- Icon libraries

**Medium Cacheability** (Medium-term caching)
- Feature-based chunks
- Page-based chunks
- UI component libraries

**Low Cacheability** (Short-term caching)
- Main application bundle
- Configuration files
- API integration code

### 2. Filename Hashing

**Content-Based Hashing**
- `[name]-[hash:8].js` for optimal cache invalidation
- Separate directories for different asset types
- Immutable caching headers support

## Build Process Integration
